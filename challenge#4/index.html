        <h3>Operating System</h3>
        <p>
          An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer
          hardware, software resources, and provides common services for
          computer programs. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for
          efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software
          for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and
          other resources. For hardware functions such as input and output and
          memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary
          between programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the
          application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and
          frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by
          it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a
          computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers
          and supercomputers.

        <h3>Theory of Computation</h3>
        <p>
          In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of
          computation is the branch that deals with what problems can be solved
          on a model of computation, using an algorithm, how efficiently they
          can be solved or to wha   t degree (e.g., approximate solutions versus
          precise ones). The field is divided into three major branches:
          automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and
          computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question:
          "What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of
          computers?".[1] In order to perform a rigorous study of computation,
          computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers
          called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but
          the most commonly examined is the Turing machine.[2] Computer
          scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate,
          can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents
          what many consider the most powerful possible "reasonable" model of
          computation (see Church–Turing thesis).[3] It might seem that the
          potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but
          any decidable problem[4] solved by a Turing machine will always
          require only a finite amount of memory. So in principle, any problem
          that can be solved (decided) by a Turing machine can be solved by a
          computer that has a finite amount of memory.

        <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on
          the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the
          form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in
          the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects
          is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the
          data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this or self). In OOP,
          computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that
          interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the
          most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances
          of classes, which also determine their types. Many of the most widely
          used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are
          multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a
          greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative,
          procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include:
          Java, C++, C#, Python, R, PHP, Visual Basic.NET, JavaScript, Ruby,
          Perl, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Common
          Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk.

        <h3>Probabilty and Statics</h3>
        <p>
          Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical
          descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is
          that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number
          between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of
          the event and 1 indicates certainty.[note 1][1][2] The higher the
          probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will
          occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin.
          Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes ("heads" and "tails") are
          both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals the
          probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the
          probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2 (which could also be
          written as 0.5 or 50%). These concepts have been given an axiomatic
          mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely
          in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance,
          gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science,
          game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the
          expected frequency of events. Probability theory is also used to
          describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex
          systems.[3]
